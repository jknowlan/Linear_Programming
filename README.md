Repo contains Jupyter notebooks that plot solutions to linear optimization
problems presented in *Linear Programming: An Introduction with Applications
Second Edition*

###Example###

**Example 2.5**: Graph the constraint set associated with Example 1.1 on Page 2, the diet problem

**Problem**: $Minimize\ C = 0.60x = 0.40y;$

Subject to the following constraints:

$\begin{cases}20x + 30y \geq 60, \\
12x + 6y \geq 24, \\
30x + 15y \geq 30, \\
x \geq 0, \\
y \geq 0
\end{cases}$

The resulting solution space is pictured below:
